# AI-2048-game
An AI-powered 2048 game uses artificial intelligence to automatically combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, optimizing moves to reach the 2048 tile or achieve the highest possible score. The AI analyzes the board and makes the most strategic moves to maximize results.
# 2048 with AI (Pygame + NumPy)

A clone of the classic **2048 puzzle game**, built with **Pygame** for graphics and **NumPy** for grid operations.  
You can play manually using the arrow keys, or toggle an **AI mode** that plays automatically using a heuristic evaluation strategy.

## ðŸ¤– AI Details
The AI chooses moves by simulating each possible direction and evaluating the resulting grid.  
Its scoring function considers:
- **Empty Cells** â†’ prefers boards with more available moves.  
- **Max Tile in Corner** â†’ rewards keeping the largest tile in a corner.  
- **Smoothness** â†’ penalizes large differences between neighboring tiles.  

This helps the AI survive longer and reach higher tiles.
