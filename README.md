## ðŸ¤– AI Details
The AI chooses moves by simulating each possible direction and evaluating the resulting grid.  
Its scoring function considers:
- **Empty Cells** â†’ prefers boards with more available moves.  
- **Max Tile in Corner** â†’ rewards keeping the largest tile in a corner.  
- **Smoothness** â†’ penalizes large differences between neighboring tiles.  

This helps the AI survive longer and reach higher tiles.
